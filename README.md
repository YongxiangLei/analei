# This repository will reveal the industrial prediction-level applications of different machine learning algorithms. It covers the ANN, LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, Transformer, CNN, ARIMA, and its variants. It will be presented in my personal book: "Learning-Based Predictions and Soft Sensing for Process Industries: Theory, Methodology and Application". I hope you can enjoy this journey.
